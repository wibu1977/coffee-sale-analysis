### Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Script

This SQL script enables coffee shop owners and managers to gain actionable insights into sales performance across multiple dimensions. By organizing sales data efficiently and transforming transaction details, this script allows businesses to track trends and evaluate performance through the following key features:

1. **Sales Trends Overview**:  
   The script identifies **daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends** by aggregating sales data (`unit_price * transaction_qty`) over time. This allows the business to monitor performance at different intervals and make data-driven decisions to capitalize on trends or address slow periods.

2. **Store Performance Analysis**:  
   By calculating the **average transaction value** across different store locations, this query provides insight into which locations are thriving and which may need optimization. Store-specific analysis highlights geographic strengths and weaknesses in the brand's strategy.

3. **Product Contribution Breakdown**:  
   The script identifies which **product categories and types contribute the most to overall sales**. This crucial information helps coffee shop management understand which products drive revenue, supporting inventory management, marketing, and menu refinement efforts.

4. **Revenue and Sales Quantity**:  
   Analyzing the **revenue and quantity sold for each product category** offers a clear understanding of product demand. The results inform pricing strategies and inventory planning to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction.

5. **Product Sales Status**:  
   The script includes a **sales performance evaluation** for each product type by comparing total quantity sold against the average. Products are categorized as "Above Average," "Below Average," or "Average," empowering the business to focus promotional efforts and manage product lifecycle effectively.
